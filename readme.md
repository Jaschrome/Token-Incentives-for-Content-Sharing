# Token Incentives for Content Sharing

## Project Title
**Token Incentives for Content Sharing**

## Project Description
This project leverages blockchain technology to reward users with tokens for sharing content. Using a custom ERC20 token, users are incentivized to contribute valuable content, verified via content hashes. The smart contract ensures transparency, fairness, and decentralized distribution of rewards.

## Project Vision
To create a decentralized platform where content creators and sharers are fairly rewarded for their contributions. The project aims to foster an ecosystem where high-quality content is encouraged, shared widely, and recognized through tokenized rewards.

## Key Features
- **ERC20 Token Integration**: Custom token named `ContentToken (CTK)`.
- **Reward Mechanism**: Automatically distributes tokens to content sharers based on owner-defined criteria.
- **Transparency**: Immutable record of content sharing and rewards.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple and efficient methods for transferring, approving, and rewarding tokens.
- **Ownership Control**: Only the contract owner can allocate rewards, ensuring fair distribution.

### How to Use
1. Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Use the `rewardContentSharer` method to reward content contributors by their wallet address and content hash.
3. Transfer tokens as needed using standard ERC20 methods.

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate with decentralized storage systems (e.g., IPFS) to verify content authenticity.
- Add a decentralized governance mechanism for reward allocation.
- Extend compatibility with Layer 2 solutions for faster and cheaper transactions.
